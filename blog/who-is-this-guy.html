        <div class="prose">
          <p>So you've stumbled onto this website. Maybe you clicked a link. Maybe you were lost on the internet and ended up here by accident. Either way, welcome. Let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>

          <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
          <p>I was born during a thunderstorm so dramatic that the hospital lights flickered three times. The doctor said it was just a power grid issue. My mother said it was destiny. I choose to believe my mother.</p>
          <p>As a child, I had two great passions: taking things apart and <em>not</em> putting them back together. My parents' alarm clock, the TV remote, the neighbor's bicycle bell &mdash; nothing was safe. I called it "research." They called it "expensive."</p>

          <h2>The Name Situation</h2>
          <p>My name is Shuo, but I also go by Ars&egrave;ne. Yes, like Ars&egrave;ne Lupin, the gentleman thief. No, I have not stolen anything of significant value. The name came from my time in France, where I quickly learned that introducing yourself as "Shuo" leads to roughly 14 different pronunciations, none of them correct. So I picked a French name that sounded cool and mysterious. It worked &mdash; people stopped mispronouncing my name and started asking if I was related to a fictional burglar instead. Progress.</p>

          <h2>Things I Am Unreasonably Good At</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Making instant noodles taste like a proper meal (the secret is an egg and a bit of self-delusion)</li>
            <li>Falling asleep on any form of public transportation within 90 seconds</li>
            <li>Convincing myself that "just one more episode" at 2 AM is a reasonable decision</li>
            <li>Finding the longest possible route when walking somewhere for the first time</li>
            <li>Typing furiously to look productive during meetings</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>MBTI: INTP (The Overthinker)</h2>
          <p>I took the MBTI test and got INTP, which apparently means I'm a "Logician." In practice, it means I will spend 45 minutes analyzing whether it's more efficient to wash dishes immediately or let them "soak" (spoiler: they never just soak). I can build you a mental model of how a toaster works from first principles, but I will forget to actually make the toast. I start conversations in my head, finish them, and then get confused when the other person doesn't know the conclusion I've already reached. Classic INTP.</p>

          <h2>Things I Am Unreasonably Bad At</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Remembering which pocket I put my keys in (answer: always the last one I check)</li>
            <li>Keeping plants alive for more than three weeks (my current record is 26 days, a basil plant named "Survivor")</li>
            <li>Saying no to dessert</li>
            <li>Leaving a bookstore without buying something</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>A Day in My Life</h2>
          <p>A typical day goes something like this:</p>
          <p><strong>7:30</strong> &mdash; Alarm rings. Hit snooze.</p>
          <p><strong>7:39</strong> &mdash; Alarm rings again. Negotiate with myself about the meaning of "five more minutes."</p>
          <p><strong>8:15</strong> &mdash; Actually get up. Stare at the ceiling and contemplate the nature of mornings.</p>
          <p><strong>9:00</strong> &mdash; Coffee. The single most important event of the day.</p>
          <p><strong>9:05</strong> &mdash; Open laptop. Stare at code. Code stares back.</p>
          <p><strong>12:00</strong> &mdash; Lunch. Probably something involving rice, because some cultural programming runs too deep.</p>
          <p><strong>14:00</strong> &mdash; The post-lunch slump. Briefly consider a nap. Drink more coffee instead.</p>
          <p><strong>17:00</strong> &mdash; Realize I've mass-produced 200 lines of code and mass-deleted 180 of them. Net progress: 20 lines. Call it a productive day.</p>
          <p><strong>23:00</strong> &mdash; "I should sleep early tonight." <em>Opens YouTube.</em></p>
          <p><strong>01:30</strong> &mdash; "How did I end up watching a documentary about deep-sea creatures?"</p>

          <h2>My Superpower</h2>
          <p>If I had to pick one superpower, it would be the ability to debug code by glaring at it hard enough. I haven't fully developed this ability yet, but I'm getting closer. Sometimes, after staring at a bug for three hours, the fix turns out to be a missing semicolon. I consider this a partial success.</p>

          <h2>Why This Website Exists</h2>
          <p>Honestly? I wanted a corner of the internet that's mine. No algorithms deciding what you see. No infinite scroll trying to steal your afternoon. Just a place where I can write things down, share what I'm working on, and maybe make someone smile.</p>
          <p>If you've read this far, you're either genuinely interested or extremely bored. Either way, I appreciate you. Stick around &mdash; it only gets weirder from here.</p>
